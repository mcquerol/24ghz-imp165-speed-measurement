+++++++++++++++++++++++ PRODUCTION ++++++++++++++++++++

If your PCB goes to production, do the following:

1. Copy the complete "work" in this folder and new name "YYMMDD_projectname_XvX"
This is year, month, day, project name and Version of the Board.

2. Comment in "VersionList.txt" the specialities of this version (e.g. intial, A-sample, new connector I2,...)

3. Store also a ZIP File of "10_KiCad_WCP" in the new Directory "YYMMDD_projectname_XvX"


+++++++++++++++++++++++ HINTS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here are some notes, how to organize your project.

10_Report
+++++++++
Put your Schematic Report here, including all the design decisions and final parameters

20_SubCirxuit_XXX
++++++++++++++++
For each subcircuit your are designing, make a copy of this folder. Store your design, your calculations and simulations here.


30_DataSheets
+++++++++++
Save the datasheets of all used components here.


40_ProjectLib
+++++++++++++
Save KiCad specific footprints, symbols, components for this project here.



50_BOM
++++++++++++++++++++++++
From the BOM exported form your project, derive this BOM (BOM_KiCad_WCP_Order.xlsx) which you are going to order.
Take the following into account:
- numver of Boards you are producing
- spare parts
- mechanical parts (e.g. distance bolts, screw nuts,....)
- orders from vendors, bills, etc.


60_Gerber
++++++++++
Save in this folder the Gerber Files, once you are going to production.


70_ReleaseNote
